# CDC Mobile App


Hybrid app written for iOS, Android and Windows Phone, using the [Ionic Framework](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic), and [Angular JS](https://github.com/angular/angular.js).

Much of the code in the app is very literal, very verbose, and purposefully so.

I've duplicated stream views all over just to be clear on what each has and does. Many of these are duplicative, and *should* be removed when these views are addressed.
