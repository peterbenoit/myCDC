These illnesses are often severe and include infections of the lining of the brain and spinal cord (meningitis) and bloodstream infections (bacteremia or septicemia).</p><p>Meningococcus bacteria are spread through the exchange of respiratory and throat secretions like spit (e.g., by living in close quarters, kissing). Meningococcal disease can be treated with antibiotics, but quick medical attention is extremely important. Keeping up to date with recommended vaccines is the best defense against meningococcal disease.</p></div></div></div></div><div class=\"syndicate\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\"><div class=\"mSyndicate\"><div class=\"module-typeA\"><h3>Signs & Symptoms</h3><div><p><img alt=\"Two teenage girls\" class=\"pull-right\" src=\"http://www.cdc.gov/meningococcal/images/hm-teenage-girls.jpg\" /></p><p>Symptoms of meningococcal disease are usually sudden onset of fever, headache, and stiff neck.
