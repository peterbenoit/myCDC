Even the best health care facilities can’t go it alone when it comes to antibiotic-resistant infections and C. difficile.</p><p>We need to protect our whole community; advance warning of possible antibiotic-resistant infections at one facility allows actions to be taken to prevent spread at the receiving facility.</p><p>New modeling data from CDC project that a community-wide approach – in which hospitals, long-term acute care facilities, nursing homes and health departments across an area work together – could reduce the number of patients infected with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (better known as CRE) by up to 70% over five years. CRE is a nightmare bacteria because it does not respond to most antibiotics and is extremely deadly should it enter the bloodstream – especially if a patient is already sick. A significant drop in these infections would be a life-saving scenario for patients.</p><p>Health care facility administrators are key to making this coordinated approach a success. Hospitals, long-term acute care facilities and nursing homes all need better systems to alert one another when transferring patients carrying drug-resistant bacteria and C. difficile. Strict infection control practices must be implemented in every health care setting, and clinical staff need access to prompt and accurate laboratory testing to identify antibiotic-resistant bacteria.</p><p>Public health departments must play a central role by tracking antibiotic-resistant threats in the area and alerting facilities to their presence. State and local health departments should dedicate staff to improve awareness and coordination between facilities to better prevent infections.</p><p>Proposed funding in the President’s budget for Fiscal Year 2016 will help turn this proven, life-saving approach into reality nationwide. The proposed budget includes funding for ‘State Protect Programs’ in all 50 states and 10 large US cities. These investments would help health care facilities better prevent outbreaks, improve antibiotic prescribing and save lives. The budget proposal for CDC also supports implementation of CDC activities in the National Strategy for Combatting Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria (CARB), which President Obama has made a top priority for improving America’s health security.</p><p>Continuing on our current path will result in hundreds of thousands more antibiotic-resistant infections plus thousands more deaths every year. Now it is up to Congress to support the vital resources needed to protect Americans from drug-resistant bacteria and the risk of a post-antibiotic age that will undermine many of the life-saving procedures of modern medicine we have come to rely on.</p><p>We need to act now to improve the way antibiotics are used in our nation so we can reduce drug-resistant bacteria. I write these words while on travel related to Ebola and other infectious disease control in Africa, where traditional wisdom notes that if you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together. Together we can do so much.</p><p><em>Tom Frieden is the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</em></p><span class=\"posted-on red-color\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Posted on</span></span><time class=\"entry-date published updated\" datetime=\"2015-08-19T15:31:33+00:00\">August 19, 2015</time>\r\n\r\nby <span class=\"cdc-author\">CDC</span><div class=\"cat-links red-color\"><span class=\"screen-reader-text\">Categories</span><a href=\"http://blogs.cdc.gov/cdcdirector/category/health-protection/\" rel=\"category tag\" target=\"_blank\">Health Protection</a></div><hr /><div id=\"cdc_comments\" class=\"comments-area\"><div class=\"module-typeA\"><h3>4 comments on “Protecting Americans from Preventable Infections: Working Together Will Save Lives”</h3><p class=\"cdc-comment-notes\">Comments listed below are posted by individuals not associated with CDC, unless otherwise stated.

We use them a lot for our family and have been very healthy. Right when we feel something coming on we head to the oils cabinet in leu of the medicine cabinet. I know that the pharmisidical companies can’t copyright nature’s cures therefore there is no profit for them in promoting them. Yet, if we truly care for the health and well-being of others we will be open to “alternative medicine”.</p><p>On another note, this morning I was shocked by an advertisement I saw before watching something on YouTube. It was by the CDC and overtly encouraged the sodomite lifestyle. Here’s the senario, two guys getting ready for the day. Camera looking from behind focused on foggy mirror. First guy draws a heart and I ♡ U. Second writes, I ♡ U 2. Then they proceed to kiss one another. What was that all about? !<br />\r\nIf we are about health and well-being we will not promote this lifestyle! I do not want my children seeing this type of advertising. Please reconsider the imagery you use next time and I would encourage you to pull that ad asap.</p><p>BTW, I did try to contact the marketing department of the CDC this morning to no avail and was not able to leave a voice message. I truly hope that you will consider the concerns of your audience.

I have been treated with every type of antibiotics there is I think. I keep getting it back over and over again, after the initial 10 rounds or so of antibiotics. I think I’ve taken another 6 rounds or so, since then. I do see a Pulmonologist regularly, and his major concern is my getting immune to antibiotics. As sick as I have gotten, that scares me a bit too. This time I’m taking steroids and antibiotics, one of the two causes me major leg pain. I don’t know why that is. Is there anything more that I could be doing to get rid of the Legionnaires and do you believe that something in my environment could be causing me to keep the Legionnaires? If you could send me an email on your opinion I would really appreciate it. I live in a small town, and we had a few people died recently in the area from Legionnaires. I’m getting very frightened. And would appreciate any answer you could come up with for me. Thank you very much.<br />\r\nLaura</p></div><div class=\"reply\"><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://blogs.cdc.gov/cdcdirector/2015/08/19/protecting-americans-from-preventable-infections-working-together-will-save-lives/?replytocom=4644#respond\" onclick=\"return addComment.moveForm( div-comment-4644, 4644, respond, 865 )\" aria-label=\"Reply to Laura Podczervinski\" target=\"_blank\">Reply</a></div></article></div></div></div><div class=\"module-typeA\"><h3>Post a Comment</h3><div id=\"cdc_respond\" class=\"comment-respond\"><h3 id=\"cdc_reply-title\" class=\"comment-reply-title\"><small><a rel=\"nofollow\" id=\"cdc_cancel-comment-reply-link\" href=\"http://blogs.cdc.gov/cdcdirector/2015/08/19/protecting-americans-from-preventable-infections-working-together-will-save-lives/#respond\" target=\"_blank\"><small>Cancel Reply</small></a></small></h3><form action=\"http://blogs.cdc.gov/cdcdirector/wp-comments-post.php\" method=\"post\" id=\"cdc_commentform\" class=\"comment-form\" novalidate=\"novalidate\"><p class=\"comment-notes\"><span id=\"cdc_email-notes\">Your email address will not be published.</span> Required fields are marked <span class=\"required\">*</span></p><p class=\"comment-form-author\"><label for=\"author\">Name <span class=\"required\">*</span></label><input id=\"cdc_author\" name=\"author\" type=\"text\" value=\"\" size=\"30\" aria-required=\"true\" required=\"required\" /></p><p class=\"comment-form-email\"><label for=\"email\">Email <span class=\"required\">*</span></label><input id=\"cdc_email\" name=\"email\" type=\"email\" value=\"\" size=\"30\" aria-describedby=\"email-notes\" aria-required=\"true\" required=\"required\" /></p><p class=\"comment-form-comment\"><label for=\"comment\">Comment</label><textarea id=\"cdc_comment\" name=\"comment\" cols=\"45\" rows=\"8\" aria-required=\"true\" required=\"required\"></textarea></p><div class=\"cdc-comment-notes\">All comments posted become a part of the public domain, and users are responsible for their comments.
