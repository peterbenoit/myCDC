Building a strong, resilient community requires preparedness efforts at all levels, starting at home with the family, and expanding to include neighborhoods, workplaces and schools, travel plans, and online communities.</p><p>Following the theme of community resilience, CDC's <i>Public Health Matters</i> (<i>2</i>) blog will feature stories about sheltering with children, Los Angeles County discussions on community preparedness, a medication dispensing exercise in Virginia, a world traveler's take on preparedness when on the move, and a look at using online networks in emergencies. Preparedness Month will also feature the release of the reports in this issue of <i>MMWR</i>, infographics, social media messages, and a Twitter Chat on community resilience on September 16. The month will culminate in the PrepareAthon's National Day of Action (<i>3</i>) on September 30.
