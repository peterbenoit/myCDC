To help address the increased crash risk for beginner teen drivers, 49 states and the District of Columbia include a night driving restriction (NDR) in their Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) system. NDRs have been shown to reduce crashes among newly licensed teens, with higher reductions associated with NDRs starting at 10:00 p.m. or earlier (2-3). However, in 23 states and the District of Columbia, NDRs begin at 12:00 a.m. or later, times when most teen drivers subject to GDL are not driving. CDC analyzed 2009-2014 national and state-level data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to determine the proportion of drivers aged 16 or 17 years involved in fatal crashes who crashed at night (9:00 p.m.-5:59 a.m.) and the proportion of these drivers who crashed before 12:00 a.m. Nationwide, among 6,104 drivers aged 16 or 17 years involved in fatal crashes during 2009-2014, 1,865 (31%) were involved in night crashes. Among drivers involved in night crashes, 1,054 (57%) crashed before 12:00 a.m. State-level analyses revealed an approximately twofold variation among states in both the proportions of drivers aged 16 or 17 years involved in fatal crashes that occurred at night and the proportions of night fatal crash involvements that occurred before 12:00 a.m. Because nearly all of the night driving trips taken by drivers aged 16 or 17 years end before 12:00 a.m., NDRs beginning at 12:00 a.m. or later provide minimal protection. States could consider updating their NDR coverage to include earlier nighttime hours. This descriptive report summarizes the characteristics of NDRs, estimates the extent to which drivers aged 16 or 17 years drive at night, and describes their involvement in fatal nighttime crashes during 2009-2014. The effects of NDRs on crashes were not evaluated because of the small state-level sample sizes during the 6-year study period.

No formal recommendation for or against the use of a third MMR dose has been issued by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (1).

Approximately 25% of U.S. adults have diagnoses of MCC (2). Care management of MCC presents a challenge to both patients and providers because of the substantial costs associated with treating more than one condition and the traditional care strategies that focus on single conditions as opposed to enhanced care coordination (3,4). Maintaining surveillance, targeting service delivery, and projecting resources are all important to meet this challenge, and these actions can be informed by identifying state and other regional variations in MCC prevalence (5,6). Data from the 2014 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) were used to estimate prevalence of MCC (defined as two or more of 10 diagnosed chronic conditions) for each U.S. state and region by age and sex. Significant state and regional variation in MCC prevalence was found, with state-level estimates ranging from 19.0% in Colorado to 38.2% in Kentucky. MCC prevalence also varied by region, ranging from 21.4% in the Pacific region to 34.5% in the East South Central region. The prevalence of MCC was higher among women than among men within certain U.S. regions, and was higher in older persons in all regions. Such findings further the research and surveillance objectives stated in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) publication, Multiple Chronic Conditions: A Strategic Framework (1). Furthermore, geographic disparities in MCC prevalence can inform state-level surveillance programs and groups targeting service delivery or allocating resources for MCC prevention activities.","language":"English","mediaType":"Feed Item","mimeType":"text/xml","encoding":"UTF-8","mediaGuid":"169698f0-843d-4bd8-a259-700552965abb","sourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529a3.htm","targetUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6529a3.htm","persistentUrlToken":null,"persistentUrl":null,"sourceCode":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","owningOrgId":null,"maintainingOrgId":null,"alternateImages":[],"alternateText":"","noScriptText":"","featuredText":"","author":"","length":"","size":null,"height":null,"width":null,"childRelationshipCount":0,"childRelationships":[],"childCount":0,"children":[],"parentCount":1,"parents":null,"parentRelationships":[{"relatedMediaId":150421,"displayOrdinal":0}],"ratingOverride":null,"ratingMinimum":0,"ratingMaximum":0,"comments":"","status":"Published","datePublished":"2016-07-28T12:03:00Z","dateLastReviewed":"","rowVersion":"AAAAAAAQpY0=","tags":{"topic":[{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","attributeName":"Topic"}]},"geoTags":[],"topics":null,"audiences":null,"canManage":false,"canShare":false,"durationSeconds":null,"eCard":null,"feed":{"editorialManager":null,"webMasterEmail":null,"copyright":null,"imageTitle":null,"imageSource":null,"imageLink":null,"imageHeight":"","imageWidth":"","imageDescription":null,"exportSettings":[]},"series":null,"dateContentAuthored":"","dateContentUpdated":"","dateContentPublished":"","dateContentReviewed":"","dateSyndicationCaptured":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","dateSyndicationUpdated":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","dateSyndicationVisible":"2016-07-28T12:03:00Z","extendedAttributes":{"AlreadyExists":"False","ImportCount":"3 of 10","LastImport":"1469815968924"},"pageCount":"","dataSize":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"enclosures":[{"id":1328,"resourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mobile/Applications/CDCGeneral/MMWRThumbnails/state_and_regional.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","size":21914}],"domainName":"","dateModified":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","dateCreated":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","createdBy":"William Scott (CDC\\WMS4)","modifiedBy":"William Scott (CDC\\WMS4)","thumbnailUrl":"https://oadc-dmb-stage-toolsadmin.cdc.gov/adminapi/v1/resources/media/164351/thumbnail.png","owningOrgName":null,"maintainingOrgName":null,"effectivePreferences":null,"preferences":null,"classNames":"","attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

To increase the proportion of pregnant women with Zika virus infection who receive a definitive diagnosis, CDC recommends expanding real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing. Possible exposures to Zika virus include travel to or residence in an area with active Zika virus transmission, or sex* with a partner who has traveled to or resides in an area with active Zika virus transmission without using condoms or other barrier methods to prevent infection.† Testing recommendations for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure who report clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease§ (symptomatic pregnant women) are the same, regardless of their level of exposure (i.e., women with ongoing risk for possible exposure, including residence in or frequent travel to an area with active Zika virus transmission, as well as women living in areas without Zika virus transmission who travel to an area with active Zika virus transmission, or have unprotected sex with a partner who traveled to or resides in an area with active Zika virus transmission). Symptomatic pregnant women who are evaluated <2 weeks after symptom onset should receive serum and urine Zika virus rRT-PCR testing. Symptomatic pregnant women who are evaluated 2-12 weeks after symptom onset should first receive a Zika virus immunoglobulin (IgM) antibody test; if the IgM antibody test result is positive or equivocal, serum and urine rRT-PCR testing should be performed. Testing recommendations for pregnant women with possible Zika virus exposure who do not report clinical illness consistent with Zika virus disease (asymptomatic pregnant women) differ based on the circumstances of possible exposure. For asymptomatic pregnant women who live in areas without active Zika virus transmission and who are evaluated <2 weeks after last possible exposure, rRT-PCR testing should be performed. If the rRT-PCR result is negative, a Zika virus IgM antibody test should be performed 2-12 weeks after the exposure. Asymptomatic pregnant women who do not live in an area with active Zika virus transmission, who are first evaluated 2-12 weeks after their last possible exposure should first receive a Zika virus IgM antibody test; if the IgM antibody test result is positive or equivocal, serum and urine rRT-PCR should be performed. Asymptomatic pregnant women with ongoing risk for exposure to Zika virus should receive Zika virus IgM antibody testing as part of routine obstetric care during the first and second trimesters; immediate rRT-PCR testing should be performed when IgM antibody test results are positive or equivocal.

Transmission of HCV is primarily via parenteral blood exposure, and HCV can be transmitted vertically from mother to child. Vertical transmission occurs in 5.8% (95% confidence interval = 4.2%-7.8%) of infants born to women who are infected only with HCV and in up to twice as many infants born to women who are also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (2) or who have high HCV viral loads (3,4); there is currently no recommended intervention to prevent transmission of infection from mother to child (3). Increased reported incidence of HCV infection among persons aged =30 years (5,6) with similar increases among women and men in this age group (6), raises concern about increases in the number of pregnant women with HCV infection, and in the number of infants who could be exposed to HCV at birth. Data from one large commercial laboratory and birth certificate data were used to investigate trends in HCV detection among women of childbearing age,* HCV testing among children aged =2 years, and the proportions of infants born to HCV-infected women nationally and in Kentucky, the state with the highest incidence of acute HCV infection during 2011-2014 (6). During 2011-2014, commercial laboratory data indicated that national rates of HCV detection (antibody or RNA positivity†) among women of childbearing age increased 22%, and HCV testing (antibody or RNA) among children aged =2 years increased 14%; birth certificate data indicated that the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected mothers increased 68%, from 0.19% to 0.32%. During the same time in Kentucky, the HCV detection rate among women of childbearing age increased >200%, HCV testing among children aged =2 years increased 151%, and the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women increased 124%, from 0.71% to 1.59%. Increases in the rate of HCV detection among women of childbearing age suggest a potential risk for vertical transmission of HCV. These findings highlight the importance of following current CDC recommendations to identify, counsel, and test persons at risk for HCV infection (1,7), including pregnant women, as well as consider developing public health policies for routine HCV testing of pregnant women, and expanding current policies for testing and monitoring children born to HCV-infected women. Expansion of HCV reporting and surveillance requirements will enhance case identification and prevention strategies.","language":"English","mediaType":"Feed Item","mimeType":"text/xml","encoding":"UTF-8","mediaGuid":"9bfc2320-b967-402b-9f59-a140172c0aa1","sourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6528a2.htm","targetUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6528a2.htm","persistentUrlToken":null,"persistentUrl":null,"sourceCode":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","owningOrgId":null,"maintainingOrgId":null,"alternateImages":[],"alternateText":"","noScriptText":"","featuredText":"","author":"","length":"","size":null,"height":null,"width":null,"childRelationshipCount":0,"childRelationships":[],"childCount":0,"children":[],"parentCount":1,"parents":null,"parentRelationships":[{"relatedMediaId":150421,"displayOrdinal":0}],"ratingOverride":null,"ratingMinimum":0,"ratingMaximum":0,"comments":"","status":"Published","datePublished":"2016-07-21T12:02:00Z","dateLastReviewed":"","rowVersion":"AAAAAAAQpZc=","tags":{"topic":[{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","attributeName":"Topic"}]},"geoTags":[],"topics":null,"audiences":null,"canManage":false,"canShare":false,"durationSeconds":null,"eCard":null,"feed":{"editorialManager":null,"webMasterEmail":null,"copyright":null,"imageTitle":null,"imageSource":null,"imageLink":null,"imageHeight":"","imageWidth":"","imageDescription":null,"exportSettings":[]},"series":null,"dateContentAuthored":"","dateContentUpdated":"","dateContentPublished":"","dateContentReviewed":"","dateSyndicationCaptured":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","dateSyndicationUpdated":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","dateSyndicationVisible":"2016-07-21T12:02:00Z","extendedAttributes":{"AlreadyExists":"False","ImportCount":"8 of 10","LastImport":"1469815968924"},"pageCount":"","dataSize":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"enclosures":[{"id":1333,"resourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mobile/Applications/CDCGeneral/MMWRThumbnails/increased_hepatitis.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","size":24386}],"domainName":"","dateModified":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","dateCreated":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","createdBy":"William Scott (CDC\\WMS4)","modifiedBy":"William Scott (CDC\\WMS4)","thumbnailUrl":"https://oadc-dmb-stage-toolsadmin.cdc.gov/adminapi/v1/resources/media/164356/thumbnail.png","owningOrgName":null,"maintainingOrgName":null,"effectivePreferences":null,"preferences":null,"classNames":"","attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

Zika virus has been identified as a cause of congenital microcephaly and other serious brain defects (2). As of June 30, 2016, CDC had issued travel notices for 49 countries and U.S. territories across much of the Western hemisphere (3), including Brazil, where the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games (Games of the XXXI Olympiad, also known as Rio 2016; Games) will be hosted in Rio de Janeiro in August and September 2016. During the Games, mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission is expected to be low because August and September are winter months in Brazil, when cooler and drier weather typically reduces mosquito populations (4). CDC conducted a risk assessment to predict those countries susceptible to ongoing Zika virus transmission resulting from introduction by a single traveler to the Games. Whereas all countries are at risk for travel-associated importation of Zika virus, CDC estimated that 19 countries currently not reporting Zika outbreaks have the environmental conditions and population susceptibility to sustain mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus if a case were imported from infection at the Games. For 15 of these 19 countries, travel to Rio de Janeiro during the Games is not estimated to increase substantially the level of risk above that incurred by the usual aviation travel baseline for these countries. The remaining four countries, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, and Yemen, are unique in that they do not have a substantial number of travelers to any country with local Zika virus transmission, except for anticipated travel to the Games. These four countries will be represented by a projected, combined total of 19 athletes (plus a projected delegation of about 60 persons), a tiny fraction of the 350,000-500,000 visitors expected at the Games.* Overall travel volume to the Games represents a very small fraction (<0.25%) of the total estimated 2015 travel volume to Zika-affected countries,† highlighting the unlikely scenario that Zika importation would be solely attributable to travel to the Games. To prevent Zika virus infection and its complications among athletes and visitors to the Games and importation of Zika virus into countries that could sustain local transmission, pregnant women should not travel to the Games, mosquito bites should be avoided while traveling and for 3 weeks after returning home, and measures should be taken to prevent sexual transmission ( Box).","language":"English","mediaType":"Feed Item","mimeType":"text/xml","encoding":"UTF-8","mediaGuid":"eb64014f-da7c-4e9a-a379-6ae614cde500","sourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6528e1.htm","targetUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6528e1.htm","persistentUrlToken":null,"persistentUrl":null,"sourceCode":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","owningOrgId":null,"maintainingOrgId":null,"alternateImages":[],"alternateText":"","noScriptText":"","featuredText":"","author":"","length":"","size":null,"height":null,"width":null,"childRelationshipCount":0,"childRelationships":[],"childCount":0,"children":[],"parentCount":1,"parents":null,"parentRelationships":[{"relatedMediaId":150421,"displayOrdinal":0}],"ratingOverride":null,"ratingMinimum":0,"ratingMaximum":0,"comments":"","status":"Published","datePublished":"2016-07-21T12:01:00Z","dateLastReviewed":"","rowVersion":"AAAAAAAQpZk=","tags":{"topic":[{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","attributeName":"Topic"}]},"geoTags":[],"topics":null,"audiences":null,"canManage":false,"canShare":false,"durationSeconds":null,"eCard":null,"feed":{"editorialManager":null,"webMasterEmail":null,"copyright":null,"imageTitle":null,"imageSource":null,"imageLink":null,"imageHeight":"","imageWidth":"","imageDescription":null,"exportSettings":[]},"series":null,"dateContentAuthored":"","dateContentUpdated":"","dateContentPublished":"","dateContentReviewed":"","dateSyndicationCaptured":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","dateSyndicationUpdated":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","dateSyndicationVisible":"2016-07-21T12:01:00Z","extendedAttributes":{"AlreadyExists":"False","ImportCount":"9 of 10","LastImport":"1469815968924"},"pageCount":"","dataSize":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"enclosures":[{"id":1334,"resourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mobile/Applications/CDCGeneral/MMWRThumbnails/zika.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","size":7671}],"domainName":"","dateModified":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","dateCreated":"2016-07-29T18:13:16Z","createdBy":"William Scott (CDC\\WMS4)","modifiedBy":"William Scott (CDC\\WMS4)","thumbnailUrl":"https://oadc-dmb-stage-toolsadmin.cdc.gov/adminapi/v1/resources/media/164357/thumbnail.png","owningOrgName":null,"maintainingOrgName":null,"effectivePreferences":null,"preferences":null,"classNames":"","attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).
