SHS exposure is more common among children ages 3 to 11 years, blacks, people living below the poverty level, and those who rent housing.\n","language":"English","mediaType":"Feed Item","mimeType":"text/xml","encoding":"UTF-8","mediaGuid":"f70574a1-4709-4690-9c61-441f84057748","sourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/tobacco/index.html","targetUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/vitalsigns/tobacco/index.html","persistentUrlToken":null,"persistentUrl":null,"sourceCode":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","owningOrgId":11,"maintainingOrgId":11,"alternateImages":[],"alternateText":"","noScriptText":"","featuredText":"","author":"","length":"","size":null,"height":null,"width":null,"childRelationshipCount":0,"childRelationships":[],"childCount":0,"children":[],"parentCount":1,"parents":null,"parentRelationships":[{"relatedMediaId":150363,"displayOrdinal":0}],"ratingOverride":null,"ratingMinimum":0,"ratingMaximum":0,"comments":"","status":"Published","datePublished":"2015-02-03T13:00:00Z","dateLastReviewed":"","rowVersion":"AAAAAAAQqSU=","tags":{"topic":[{"id":5717,"name":"Health and Wellness","language":"English","attributeName":"Topic"}],"contentgroup":[{"id":6292,"name":"Vital Signs","language":"English","attributeName":"ContentGroup"}]},"geoTags":[],"topics":null,"audiences":null,"canManage":false,"canShare":false,"durationSeconds":null,"eCard":null,"feed":{"editorialManager":null,"webMasterEmail":null,"copyright":null,"imageTitle":null,"imageSource":null,"imageLink":null,"imageHeight":"","imageWidth":"","imageDescription":null,"exportSettings":[]},"series":null,"dateContentAuthored":"","dateContentUpdated":"","dateContentPublished":"","dateContentReviewed":"","dateSyndicationCaptured":"2015-10-16T18:17:14Z","dateSyndicationUpdated":"2016-07-29T18:59:07Z","dateSyndicationVisible":"2015-02-03T13:00:00Z","extendedAttributes":{"AlreadyExists":"True","ImportCount":"16 of 49","LastImport":"1469818726725"},"pageCount":"","dataSize":null,"omnitureChannel":null,"enclosures":[{"id":1522,"resourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mobile/Applications/CDCGeneral/VitalSignsThumbnails/2015_02.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","size":26248}],"domainName":"","dateModified":"2016-07-29T18:59:07Z","dateCreated":"2015-10-16T18:17:14Z","createdBy":"William Scott (CDC\\WMS4)","modifiedBy":"William Scott (CDC\\WMS4)","thumbnailUrl":"https://oadc-dmb-stage-toolsadmin.cdc.gov/adminapi/v1/resources/media/150372/thumbnail.png","owningOrgName":"OADC","maintainingOrgName":"OADC","effectivePreferences":null,"preferences":null,"classNames":"","attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

Those most at risk are people, especially older adults, who take antibiotics and also get medical care. When a person takes antibiotics, good germs that protect against infection are destroyed for several months. During this time, patients can get sick from C. difficile picked up from contaminated surfaces or spread from a health care provider's hands. About 25% of C. difficile infections first show symptoms in hospital patients; 75% first show in nursing home patients or in people recently cared for in doctors' offices and clinics.
