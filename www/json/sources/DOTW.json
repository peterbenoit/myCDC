It is common in tropical and sub-tropical countries, and is spread to people through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito. Most people infected with dengue have mild or no symptoms. About 1 in 4 people who are infected with dengue will develop symptoms including fever and headache, eye pain, muscle, joint or bone pain, rash or nausea. Though most people recover in about a week, up to 5% of people infected will develop severe dengue. Severe dengue can result in shock, internal bleeding, and even death. The best way to prevent a dengue infection is to prevent mosquito bites.",
