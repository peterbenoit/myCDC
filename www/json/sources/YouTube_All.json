I came to CDC in 1998 from Healthy Mothers Healthy Babies, a small nonprofit organization serving mothers and babies in Georgia. As a deputy branch chief, my role is to carry water and make sure the trains run on time. What this means is even though administration may seem droll, I provide the support for the scientists so that they can effectively conduct their research and work with our partners in the most efficient way possible. I make that happen. The work I do provides funding to states to help mothers deliver babies in the healthiest way possible. That’s so important, and I’m proud to be a part of the team. My path to public health was a little unexpected. I started out planning to be the world’s greatest obstetrician gynecologist, but I found public health, fell in love with it, and it has been my passion ever since. I’m Martha Boisseau and I am CDC.\n\r\n\r\nComments on this video are allowed in accordance with our comment policy: http://www.cdc.gov/SocialMedia/Tools/CommentPolicy.html\r\n\r\nThis video can also be viewed at \r\nhttp://www.cdc.gov/about/videos/IamCdcBoisseauExt/IAmCdcBoisseau-EXT.mp4",

Often clean-up levels are set at an added risk of 1 in 1,000 or 1 in 1,000,000 people developing cancer because of some chemical exposure. This does not mean you will get cancer from the chemical exposure; it means you have a slightly increased chance from your baseline risk. For example, since about 500 of every 1,000 men will get cancer in their lifetime, if there was an added risk of 1 in 1,000, then 501 men of every 1,000 men will get cancer.  For these 501 men, we could not tell which one may have gotten cancer from the chemical exposure or which ones got cancer because of other factors.\n\n\r\n\r\nComments on this video are allowed in accordance with our comment policy: http://www.cdc.gov/SocialMedia/Tools/CommentPolicy.html\r\n\r\nThis video can also be viewed at \r\nhttp://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/wcms/videos/low-res/ATSDR/2015/cn_1f_850865.mp4",

A finding of more cancers than expected in an area does not mean there is a single cause or risk that can be identified or addressed. The finding can be due to chance, known risk factors, unknown causes, and other reasons.

Remember that cancer is common, and refers to about 100 different disease , and there are many causes. On average, about 5 out of every 100 people in your community are either living with cancer or have survived cancer.  One out of two men and one out of three women will have cancer in their lifetime. Age, race, family history, and behavior and environmental factors influence who gets cancer. Members of the community might share some of these risk factors. For example, black men have a higher rate of getting cancer than white men and about 75 percent of all new cancer cases are in people over 55.\r\n\r\nComments on this video are allowed in accordance with our comment policy: http://www.cdc.gov/SocialMedia/Tools/CommentPolicy.html\r\n\r\nThis video can also be viewed at \r\nhttp://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/wcms/videos/low-res/ATSDR/2015/cn_2a_842387.mp4",
