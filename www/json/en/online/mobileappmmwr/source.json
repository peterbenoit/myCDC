CDC's National HIV Behavioral Surveillance (NHBS) monitors behaviors among populations at risk for acquiring or transmitting HIV infection. In 2012, NHBS data indicated that 9% of persons who inject drugs tested positive for HIV, and among those persons, 36% were unaware of their infection before testing (2). In 2013, 2% of heterosexuals at increased risk for HIV infection tested positive for HIV, and among those, 44% were unaware of their infection before testing (3).

National HIV testing campaigns are useful for promoting HIV testing among large numbers of persons. However, the impact of such campaigns on identification of new HIV-positive diagnoses is unclear. To assess whether National HIV Testing Day (NHTD, June 27) was effective in identifying new HIV-positive diagnoses, National HIV Prevention Program Monitoring and Evaluation (NHM&E) data for CDC-funded testing events conducted during 2011-2014 were analyzed. The number of HIV testing events and new HIV-positive diagnoses during June of each year were compared with those in other months by demographics and target populations. The number of HIV testing events and new HIV-positive diagnoses were also compared for each day leading up to and after NHTD in June and July of each year. New HIV-positive diagnoses peaked in June relative to other months and specifically on NHTD. During 2011-2014, NHTD had a substantial impact on increasing the number of persons who knew their HIV status and in diagnosing new HIV infections. NHTD also proved effective in reaching persons at high risk disproportionately affected by HIV, including African American (black) men, men who have sex with men (MSM), and transgender persons. Promoting NHTD can successfully increase the number of new HIV-positive diagnoses, including HIV infections among target populations at high risk for HIV infection.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

Racial and ethnic minorities continue to be disproportionately affected by HIV; there are 13 new diagnoses each year per 100,000 white males, 94 per 100,000 black males, and 42 per 100,000 Hispanic males (1). Despite the recommendation by CDC for HIV testing of adults and adolescents (2), in 2014, only 36% of U.S. males aged =18 years reported ever having an HIV test (3), and in 2012, an estimated 15% of males living with HIV had undiagnosed HIV infection (4). To identify opportunities for HIV diagnosis in young males, CDC analyzed data from the 2009-2012 National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and U.S. Census data to estimate rates of health care use at U.S. physicians' offices and HIV testing at these encounters. During 2009-2012, white males visited physicians' offices more often (average annual rate of 1.6 visits per person) than black males (0.9 visits per person) and Hispanic males (0.8 visits per person). Overall, an HIV test was performed at 1.0% of visits made by young males to physicians' offices, with higher testing rates among black males (2.7%) and Hispanic males (1.4%), compared with white males (0.7%). Although higher proportions of black and Hispanic males received HIV testing at health care visits compared with white males, this benefit is likely attenuated by a lower rate of health care visits. Interventions to routinize HIV testing at U.S physicians' offices could be implemented to improve HIV testing coverage.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

Children who are exposed to secondhand smoke are at increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, middle ear disease, more severe asthma, respiratory symptoms, and slowed lung growth (1,2). Secondhand smoke exposure contributes to approximately 41,000 deaths among nonsmoking adults and 400 deaths in infants each year (2). This report updates a previous CDC report that evaluated state smoke-free laws in effect from 2000-2010 (3), and estimates the proportion of the population protected by comprehensive smoke-free laws. The number of states, including the District of Columbia (DC), with comprehensive smoke-free laws (statutes that prohibit smoking in indoor areas of worksites, restaurants, and bars) increased from zero in 2000 to 26 in 2010 and 27 in 2015. The percentage of the U.S. population that is protected increased from 2.72% in 2000 to 47.8% in 2010 and 49.6% in 2015. Regional disparities remain in the proportions of state populations covered by state or local comprehensive smoke-free policies, as no state in the southeast has a state comprehensive law. In addition, nine of the 24 states that lack state comprehensive smoke-free laws also lack any local comprehensive smoke-free laws. Opportunities exist to accelerate the adoption of smoke-free laws in states that lack local comprehensive smoke-free laws, including those in the south, to protect nonsmokers from the harmful effects of secondhand smoke exposure.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

The Community Preventive Services Task Force has recommended a range of community-level evidence-based approaches† to increase physical activity by improving neighborhood supports for physical activity.§ To assess the characteristics of adolescents who live in neighborhoods that are supportive of physical activity, CDC analyzed data on U.S. children and adolescents aged 10-17 years (defined as adolescents for this report) from the 2011-2012 National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH). Overall, 65% of U.S. adolescents live in neighborhoods supportive of physical activity, defined as neighborhoods that are perceived as safe and have sidewalks or walking paths and parks, playgrounds, or recreation centers. Adolescents who were Hispanic and non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity; who lived in lower-income households, households with less educated parents, and rural areas; or who were overweight or obese were less likely to live in neighborhoods supportive of physical activity than were white adolescents and adolescents from higher income households, with a more highly educated parent, living in urban areas, and not overweight or obese. Within demographic groups, the largest disparity in the percentage of adolescents living in these neighborhoods was observed between adolescents living in households with a family income <100% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) (51%) and adolescents living in households with a family income =400% of the FPL (76%). Efforts to improve neighborhood supports, particularly in areas with a substantial percentage of low-income and minority residents, might increase physical activity among adolescents and reduce health disparities.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

Challenges in providing family planning services to men, including preconception health, infertility, contraceptive, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) care (3,4), include their infrequent use of preventive health services, a perceived lack of need for these services (1,5), and the lack of provider guidance regarding men's reproductive health care needs (4). Since 1970, the National Title X Family Planning Program has provided cost-effective and confidential family planning and related preventive health services with priority for services to low-income women and men. To examine men's use of services at Title X service sites, CDC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Population Affairs (OPA) analyzed data from the 2003-2014 Family Planning Annual Reports (FPAR), annual data that are required of all Title X-funded agencies. During 2003-2014, 3.8 million males visited Title X service sites in the United States and the percentage of family planning users who were male nearly doubled from 4.5% (221,425 males) in 2003 to 8.8% (362,531 males) in 2014. In 2014, the percentage of family planning users who were male varied widely by state, ranging from =1% in Mississippi, Tennessee, and Alabama to 27.2% in the District of Columbia (DC). Title X service sites are increasingly providing services for males. Health care settings might want to adopt the framework employed by Title X clinics to better provide family planning and related preventative services to men (3).","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

Nigeria has the fourth highest annual number of TB cases among countries, with an estimated incidence of 322 per 100,000 population (1), and the second highest prevalence of HIV infection, with 3.4 million infected persons (2). In 2014, 100,000 incident TB cases and 78,000 TB deaths occurred among persons living with HIV infection in Nigeria (1). Nosocomial transmission is a significant source of TB infection in resource-limited settings (3), and persons with HIV infection and health care workers are at increased risk for TB infection because of their routine exposure to patients with TB in health care facilities (3–5). A lack of TB infection control in health care settings has resulted in outbreaks of TB and drug-resistant TB among patients and health care workers, leading to excess morbidity and mortality. In March 2015, in collaboration with the Nigeria Ministry of Health (MoH), CDC implemented a pilot initiative, aimed at increasing health care worker knowledge about TB infection control, assessing infection control measures in health facilities, and developing plans to address identified gaps. The approach resulted in substantial improvements in TB infection control practices at seven selected facilities, and scale-up of these measures across other facilities might lead to a reduction in TB transmission in Nigeria and globally.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

The association between maternal Zika virus infection and adverse fetal and reproductive outcomes, including microcephaly, prompted CDC to issue a Level 2 alert travel notice* for the 37 countries and U.S. territories (at the national and territorial level) that have reported recent Zika virus transmission as of March 11, 2016. In addition to mosquito bite precautions for all travelers, CDC advises that pregnant women postpone travel to affected countries and U.S. territories. Within a nation’s borders, ecologic characteristics, which determine the distribution of mosquito vectors, can vary considerably. CDC conducted a spatial analysis, focusing on the probability of occurrence of Ae. aegypti, to support the demarcation for subnational travel alerts. Based on results of this analysis, travel that is limited to elevations higher than 2,000 m (6,562 ft) above sea level is considered to have minimal (approximately 1%) likelihood for mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission, even within countries reporting active transmission. Women who are pregnant should avoid travel to elevations <2,000 m in countries with active Zika virus transmission.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

For example, poverty has been shown to have adverse effects on cognitive, socio-emotional, and physical development (1). A safe place to play is needed for gross motor development, and accessible health care is needed for preventive and illness health care (3). Positive parenting and quality preschool interventions have been shown to be associated with prosocial skills, better educational outcomes, and fewer health risk behaviors over time (2). Protective factors for MBDDs are often shared (4) and conditions often co-occur; therefore, CDC considered MBDDs together to facilitate the identification of factors that could inform collaborative, multidisciplinary prevention strategies. To identify specific factors associated with MBDDs among U.S. children aged 2–8 years, parent-reported data from the most recent (2011–2012) National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH) were analyzed. Factors associated with having any MBDD included inadequate insurance, lacking a medical home, fair or poor parental mental health, difficulties getting by on the family’s income, employment difficulties because of child care issues, living in a neighborhood lacking support, living in a neighborhood lacking amenities (e.g., sidewalks, park, recreation center, and library), and living in a neighborhood in poor condition. In a multivariate analysis, fair or poor parental mental health and lacking a medical home were significantly associated with having an MBDD. There was significant variation in the prevalence of these and the other factors by state, suggesting that programs and policies might use collaborative efforts to focus on specific factors. Addressing identified factors might prevent the onset of MBDDs and improve outcomes among children who have one or more of these disorders.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

Guinea was declared Ebola-free on December 29, 2015, and is under a 90 day period of enhanced surveillance, following 3,351 confirmed and 453 probable cases of Ebola and 2,536 deaths (3). Passive surveillance for Ebola in Guinea has been conducted principally through the use of a telephone alert system. Community members and health facilities report deaths and suspected Ebola cases to local alert numbers operated by prefecture health departments or to a national toll-free call center. The national call center additionally functions as a source of public health information by responding to questions from the public about Ebola. To evaluate the sensitivity of the two systems and compare the sensitivity of the national call center with the local alerts system, the CDC country team performed probabilistic record linkage of the combined prefecture alerts database, as well as the national call center database, with the national viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) database; the VHF database contains records of all known confirmed Ebola cases. Among 17,309 alert calls analyzed from the national call center, 71 were linked to 1,838 confirmed Ebola cases in the VHF database, yielding a sensitivity of 3.9%. The sensitivity of the national call center was highest in the capital city of Conakry (11.4%) and lower in other prefectures. In comparison, the local alerts system had a sensitivity of 51.1%. Local public health infrastructure plays an important role in surveillance in an epidemic setting.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

To examine state-level prevalence of self-reported, physician-diagnosed (diagnosed) diabetes and risk factors among Asians and NHPIs aged =18 years, CDC analyzed data from the 2011–2014 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Among five states and Guam with sufficient data about NHPIs for analysis, the age-adjusted diabetes prevalence estimate for NHPIs ranged from 13.4% (New York) to 19.1% (California). Among 32 states, the District of Columbia (DC), and Guam that had sufficient data about Asians for analysis, diabetes prevalence estimates for Asians ranged from 4.9% (Arizona) to 15.3% (New York). In the five states and Guam with sufficient NHPI data, NHPIs had a higher age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes than did Asians, and a higher proportion of NHPIs were overweight or obese and had less than a high school education compared with Asians. Effective interventions and policies might reduce the prevalence of diabetes in these growing, high-risk minority populations.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

Since 1974, global coverage with the four core vaccines (Bacille Calmette-Guérin vaccine [BCG; for protection against tuberculosis], diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis [DTP] vaccine, poliovirus vaccine, and measles vaccine) has increased from <5% to =85%, and additional vaccines have been added to the recommended schedule. Coverage with the 3rd dose of DTP vaccine (DTP3) by age 12 months is an indicator of immunization program performance because it reflects completion of the basic infant immunization schedule; coverage with other vaccines, including the 3rd dose of poliovirus vaccine (polio3); the 1st dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) is also assessed. Estimated global DTP3 coverage has remained at 84%–86% since 2009, with estimated 2014 coverage at 86%. Estimated global coverage for the 2nd routine dose of measles-containing vaccine (MCV2) was 38% by age 24 months and 56% when older age groups were included, similar to levels reported in 2013 (36% and 55%, respectively). To reach and sustain high immunization coverage in all countries, adequate vaccine stock management and additional opportunities for immunization, such as through routine visits in the second year of life, are integral components to strengthening immunization programs and reducing morbidity and mortality from vaccine preventable diseases.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

During 2012, 13 cases of meningococcal disease among MSM were reported by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (1); over a 5-month period during 2012–2013, the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health reported four cases among MSM; and during May–June 2015, the Chicago Department of Public Health reported seven cases of meningococcal disease among MSM in the greater Chicago area. MSM have not previously been considered at increased risk for meningococcal disease. Determining outbreak thresholds* for special populations of unknown size (such as MSM) can be difficult. The New York City health department declared an outbreak based on an estimated increased risk for meningococcal infection in 2012 among MSM and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)–infected MSM compared with city residents who were not MSM or for whom MSM status was unknown (1). The Chicago Department of Public Health also declared an outbreak based on an increase in case counts and thresholds calculated using population estimates of MSM and HIV-infected MSM. Local public health response included increasing awareness among MSM, conducting contact tracing and providing chemoprophylaxis to close contacts, and offering vaccination to the population at risk (1–3). To better understand the epidemiology and burden of meningococcal disease in MSM populations in the United States and to inform recommendations, CDC analyzed data from a retrospective review of reported cases from January 2012 through June 2015.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10769,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5912,"name":"MMWR","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).
