Is it possible to make the world safe and secure from infectious disease threats, whether natural or man-made? Yes, it’s not only possible – it’s underway. A coalition of 48 member countries have now committed to the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), originally launched in February 2014. The GHSA provides a framework to ensure that all nations are able to prevent, detect, and rapidly respond to infectious disease threats – protecting these countries and protecting","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":10749,"name":"MobileApp CDC Director Blog","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":5717,"name":"Health and Wellness","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"geoTags":[],"campaigns":[],"source":{"name":"Centers for Disease Control and Prevention","acronym":"CDC","websiteUrl":"","largeLogoUrl":"","smallLogoUrl":""},"attribution":"<div id=\"cdcAttribution\">Content provided and maintained by the <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/\" target=\"_blank\">US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> (CDC).

As Ebola spread through the densely populated urban center of Monrovia, Liberia, cases overwhelmed the country’s fragile health infrastructure. Hospitals and Ebola treatment units overflowed with sick and suffering patients; television crews filmed people dying in the streets.
