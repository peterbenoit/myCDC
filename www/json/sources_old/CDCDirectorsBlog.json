A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) projects that thousands of lives could be saved every year if health care facilities and public health departments work together to track and stop antibiotic resistance – and if they communicate with each other about these infections to prevent spread from one facility to another.

The largest racial or ethnic minority group in the United States, Hispanics’ health differs from non-Hispanic Americans. And health issues vary greatly among Hispanics by country of origin.

In Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, there are thousands of small villages that can only be reached after many hours of walking down a footpath. Sometimes just getting to that footpath involves",

Many factors are contributing to this decline, including the adoption of safe burials and the emphasis on quickly getting patients into Ebola treatment units or community care centers and community initiatives to isolate and care for patients and track contacts. One promising development has been Liberia’s creation of RITE teams (short for Rapid Isolation and Treatment of Ebola). These teams are slowing the epidemic, and CDC is working closely with governments and partners in Guinea and Sierra Leone to adopt similar rapid response strategies.
