Transmission of HCV is primarily via parenteral blood exposure, and HCV can be transmitted vertically from mother to child. Vertical transmission occurs in 5.8% (95% confidence interval = 4.2%-7.8%) of infants born to women who are infected only with HCV and in up to twice as many infants born to women who are also infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (2) or who have high HCV viral loads (3,4); there is currently no recommended intervention to prevent transmission of infection from mother to child (3). Increased reported incidence of HCV infection among persons aged =30 years (5,6) with similar increases among women and men in this age group (6), raises concern about increases in the number of pregnant women with HCV infection, and in the number of infants who could be exposed to HCV at birth. Data from one large commercial laboratory and birth certificate data were used to investigate trends in HCV detection among women of childbearing age,* HCV testing among children aged =2 years, and the proportions of infants born to HCV-infected women nationally and in Kentucky, the state with the highest incidence of acute HCV infection during 2011-2014 (6). During 2011-2014, commercial laboratory data indicated that national rates of HCV detection (antibody or RNA positivity†) among women of childbearing age increased 22%, and HCV testing (antibody or RNA) among children aged =2 years increased 14%; birth certificate data indicated that the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected mothers increased 68%, from 0.19% to 0.32%. During the same time in Kentucky, the HCV detection rate among women of childbearing age increased >200%, HCV testing among children aged =2 years increased 151%, and the proportion of infants born to HCV-infected women increased 124%, from 0.71% to 1.59%. Increases in the rate of HCV detection among women of childbearing age suggest a potential risk for vertical transmission of HCV. These findings highlight the importance of following current CDC recommendations to identify, counsel, and test persons at risk for HCV infection (1,7), including pregnant women, as well as consider developing public health policies for routine HCV testing of pregnant women, and expanding current policies for testing and monitoring children born to HCV-infected women. Expansion of HCV reporting and surveillance requirements will enhance case identification and prevention strategies.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":38146,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":26063,"name":"Public Health","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"sourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6528a2.htm","syndicateUrl":"http://oadc-dmb-dev-service.cdc.gov/api/v2/resources/media/441186/syndicate.json","datePublished":"2016-07-21T12:02:00Z","dateModified":"2016-07-26T13:44:54Z","enclosures":[{"id":40124,"resourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mobile/Applications/CDCGeneral/MMWRThumbnails/increased_hepatitis.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","size":24386}]},{"id":441187,"name":"Projected Zika Virus Importation and Subsequent Ongoing Transmission after Travel to the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games - Country-Specific Assessment, July 2016","description":"Zika virus belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae; it is transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes species mosquito (e.g., Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) (1). Zika virus has been identified as a cause of congenital microcephaly and other serious brain defects (2). As of June 30, 2016, CDC had issued travel notices for 49 countries and U.S. territories across much of the Western hemisphere (3), including Brazil, where the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games (Games of the XXXI Olympiad, also known as Rio 2016; Games) will be hosted in Rio de Janeiro in August and September 2016. During the Games, mosquito-borne Zika virus transmission is expected to be low because August and September are winter months in Brazil, when cooler and drier weather typically reduces mosquito populations (4). CDC conducted a risk assessment to predict those countries susceptible to ongoing Zika virus transmission resulting from introduction by a single traveler to the Games. Whereas all countries are at risk for travel-associated importation of Zika virus, CDC estimated that 19 countries currently not reporting Zika outbreaks have the environmental conditions and population susceptibility to sustain mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus if a case were imported from infection at the Games. For 15 of these 19 countries, travel to Rio de Janeiro during the Games is not estimated to increase substantially the level of risk above that incurred by the usual aviation travel baseline for these countries. The remaining four countries, Chad, Djibouti, Eritrea, and Yemen, are unique in that they do not have a substantial number of travelers to any country with local Zika virus transmission, except for anticipated travel to the Games. These four countries will be represented by a projected, combined total of 19 athletes (plus a projected delegation of about 60 persons), a tiny fraction of the 350,000-500,000 visitors expected at the Games.* Overall travel volume to the Games represents a very small fraction (<0.25%) of the total estimated 2015 travel volume to Zika-affected countries,† highlighting the unlikely scenario that Zika importation would be solely attributable to travel to the Games. To prevent Zika virus infection and its complications among athletes and visitors to the Games and importation of Zika virus into countries that could sustain local transmission, pregnant women should not travel to the Games, mosquito bites should be avoided while traveling and for 3 weeks after returning home, and measures should be taken to prevent sexual transmission ( Box).","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":38146,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":26063,"name":"Public Health","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"sourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6528e1.htm","syndicateUrl":"http://oadc-dmb-dev-service.cdc.gov/api/v2/resources/media/441187/syndicate.json","datePublished":"2016-07-21T12:01:00Z","dateModified":"2016-07-26T13:44:54Z","enclosures":[{"id":40125,"resourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mobile/Applications/CDCGeneral/MMWRThumbnails/zika.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","size":7671}]},{"id":441188,"name":"Suspected Female-to-Male Sexual Transmission of Zika Virus - New York City, 2016","description":"A routine investigation by the New York City (NYC) Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) identified a nonpregnant woman in her twenties who reported she had engaged in a single event of condomless vaginal intercourse with a male partner the day she returned to NYC (day 0) from travel to an area with ongoing Zika virus transmission. She had headache and abdominal cramping while in the airport awaiting return to NYC. The following day (day 1) she developed fever, fatigue, a maculopapular rash, myalgia, arthralgia, back pain, swelling of the extremities, and numbness and tingling in her hands and feet. In addition, on day 1, the woman began menses that she described as heavier than usual. On day 3 she visited her primary care provider who obtained blood and urine specimens. Zika virus RNA was detected in both serum and urine by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) performed at the DOHMH Public Health Laboratory using a test based on an assay developed at CDC (1). The results of serum testing for anti-Zika virus immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody performed by the New York State Department of Health Wadsworth Center laboratory was negative using the CDC Zika IgM antibody capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Zika MAC-ELISA) (2).","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":38146,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":26063,"name":"Public Health","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"sourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6528e2.htm","syndicateUrl":"http://oadc-dmb-dev-service.cdc.gov/api/v2/resources/media/441188/syndicate.json","datePublished":"2016-07-21T12:00:00Z","dateModified":"2016-07-26T13:44:54Z","enclosures":[{"id":40126,"resourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mobile/Applications/CDCGeneral/MMWRThumbnails/zika_sex.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","size":6130}]},{"id":441174,"name":"0020955","description":"Created by CDC Sr. Systems Analyst, Julian Buckmaster, this image depicts a line of Haitian school children who had gathered in order to receive a two-drug treatment for lymphatic filariasis (LF), which was being administered by community members seated at a desk on the right.

To estimate tobacco use among U.S. adults aged =18 years, CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) analyzed data from the 2013-2014 National Adult Tobacco Survey (NATS). During 2013-2014, 21.3% of U.S. adults used a tobacco product every day or some days, and 25.5% of U.S. adults used a tobacco product every day, some days, or rarely. Despite progress in reducing cigarette smoking, during 2013-2014, cigarettes remained the most commonly used tobacco product among adults. Young adults aged 18-24 years reported the highest prevalence of use of emerging tobacco products, including water pipes/hookahs and electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes). Furthermore, racial/ethnic and sociodemographic differences in the use of any tobacco product were observed, with higher use reported among males; non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and non-Hispanics of other races†; persons aged <45 years; persons living in the Midwest or South; persons with a General Educational Development (GED) certificate; persons who were single/never married/not living with a partner or divorced/separated/widowed; persons with annual household income <$20,000; and persons who were lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB). Population-level interventions that focus on all forms of tobacco product use, including tobacco price increases, high-impact anti-tobacco mass media campaigns, comprehensive smoke-free laws, and enhanced access to help quitting tobacco use, in conjunction with FDA regulation of tobacco products, are critical to reducing tobacco-related diseases and deaths in the United States.§","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":38146,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":26063,"name":"Public Health","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"sourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6527a1.htm","syndicateUrl":"http://oadc-dmb-dev-service.cdc.gov/api/v2/resources/media/441189/syndicate.json","datePublished":"2016-07-14T12:03:00Z","dateModified":"2016-07-26T13:44:54Z","enclosures":[{"id":40127,"resourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mobile/Applications/CDCGeneral/MMWRThumbnails/tobacco_product.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","size":69085}]},{"id":441190,"name":"Acute Poisonings from Synthetic Cannabinoids - 50 U.S. Toxicology Investigators Consortium Registry Sites, 2010-2015","description":"Recent reports suggest that acute intoxications by synthetic cannabinoids are increasing in the United States (1,2). Synthetic cannabinoids, which were research compounds in the 1980s, are now produced overseas; the first shipment recognized to contain synthetic cannabinoids was seized at a U.S. border in 2008 (3). Fifteen synthetic cannabinoids are Schedule I controlled substances (3), but enforcement is hampered by the continual introduction of new chemical compounds (1,3). Studies of synthetic cannabinoids indicate higher cannabinoid receptor binding affinities, effects two to 100 times more potent than ?9-tetrahydrocannabinol (the principal psychoactive constituent of cannabis), noncannabinoid receptor binding, and genotoxicity (4,5). Acute synthetic cannabinoid exposure reportedly causes a range of mild to severe neuropsychiatric, cardiovascular, renal, and other effects (4,6,7); chronic use might lead to psychosis (6,8). During 2010-2015, physicians in the Toxicology Investigators Consortium (ToxIC) treated 456 patients for synthetic cannabinoid intoxications; 277 of the 456 patients reported synthetic cannabinoids as the sole toxicologic agent. Among these 277 patients, the most common clinical signs of intoxication were neurologic (agitation, central nervous system depression/coma, and delirium/toxic psychosis). Relative to all cases logged by 50 different sites in the ToxIC Case Registry, there was a statistically significant association between reporting year and the annual proportion of synthetic cannabinoid cases. In 2015, reported cases of synthetic cannabinoid intoxication increased at several ToxIC sites, corroborating reported upward trends in the numbers of such cases (1,2) and underscoring the need for prevention.","mediaType":"Feed Item","language":{"name":"English","isoCode":"eng","isoCode2":"en"},"tags":[{"id":38146,"name":"MobileApp MMWR","language":"English","type":"ContentGroup"},{"id":26063,"name":"Public Health","language":"English","type":"Topic"}],"sourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/wr/mm6527a2.htm","syndicateUrl":"http://oadc-dmb-dev-service.cdc.gov/api/v2/resources/media/441190/syndicate.json","datePublished":"2016-07-14T12:02:00Z","dateModified":"2016-07-26T13:44:54Z","enclosures":[{"id":40128,"resourceUrl":"http://www.cdc.gov/mobile/Applications/CDCGeneral/MMWRThumbnails/acute_poisoning.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg","size":30928}]},{"id":441191,"name":"Notes from the Field: Meningococcal Disease in an International Traveler on Eculizumab Therapy - United States, 2015","description":"On June 2, 2015, CDC was notified that a male airline passenger, aged 41 years, with a fever of 105.4°F, headache, nausea, photophobia, diarrhea, and vomiting, which began approximately 3 hours after departure, was arriving to San Francisco, California, on a flight from Frankfurt, Germany.
